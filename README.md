Helloï¼Œeverybody is outside there:
 I have made an outline of GRE Argument and now want to release the beta version of the outline for the reason that I'm busy with my class work now. So I wish someone of can carry on the job to better improve and finish the task for every gret test taker in China.
 
You can see the html format of the work here to decide whether or not you need to download the pdf file.

And I  created repository gre-argument in github so you can comment it and send the debug to me in sikisis@163.com.

Thank you all.

PS: the pdf file can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/iphyer/gre-argument/downloads

chose download as zip in windows or mac others like me in Linux can chose tar.gz.
